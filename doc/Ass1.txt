My optimal coefficients and magnification factor:

From my phones dimensions:

w = 0.1290m
h = 0.0640m
b = 0.0040m

and the given dimensions for eye separation, eye relief and focal length:

d_sep = 0.0640m
d_eye = 0.0180m
l = 0.0500m;

I could easily calculate the aspect ration and Left eye right eye offset.

For the calculation of the magnification factor, the distance to the object d_o was needed. This distance is measured from the lense to the display of the smartphone.
After choosing d_o by measuring it approximately, I found it better to decrease the value of d_o a bit, so that the scenes does not look that much zoomed in. My best parameter for d_o was found with

d_o = 0.0350m

which gives a magnification factor of

M = 3.333

The most difficult part was to find optimal coefficients K1 and K2 for the Grid distortion. After a lot of trial and errors I found it best to first find a good value for K2, cause most of the lenses distortions happens at the edge of the view and K2 stongly influences the vertices more far away from the center. I used a Barrel distortion for K2 (negativ value) to equalize the pincusion distotion at the edges. This however also distortes the center to middle ranges in a bad way, so that I needed to correct this by K1 used as pincusion distortion (positive value). After switching between these two values and fine tune them, I found the best coefficients with:

K1 = 0.033
K2 = -0.068

Also I reduced the view of the smartphone with the Os value to ensure that the two images do not interfere with each eyes view and to safe some rendering for unseen content. I picked the value:

OS = -0.125
